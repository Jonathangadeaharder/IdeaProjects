## Qwen Added Memories
- Always use the virtual environment (venv) when running Python commands for the LangPlug project
- The main startup script is start.bat which handles cleanup and starts both backend and frontend servers
- Backend server runs on port 8000 and frontend on port 3000
- Management scripts include stop.bat and status.bat for controlling the servers
- Documentation files (README.md, README_STARTUP.md, SETUP_GUIDE.md) have been updated to reflect the current startup process
