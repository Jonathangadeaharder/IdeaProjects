  "rules": [
    "Never mention Claude in commits - Use generic language for AI-generated content markers",
    "Format: <type>: <description> (imperative, lowercase, ≤50 chars)",
    "Types: feat, fix, docs, refactor, test, chore",
    "Focus: One logical change per commit",
    "Keep functions < 20 lines, do one thing well, < 4 parameters",
    "Use intention-revealing, pronounceable, searchable names",
    "Explain 'why' not 'what' in comments, remove dead code",
    "Use exceptions, handle at appropriate levels",
    "Classes and functions have one clear purpose",
    "60% minimum (acceptable), 80% target (commendable) test coverage",
    "Test interfaces, not implementations",
    "Tests must be deterministic, isolated, and fast",
    "Never treat 4xx/5xx/timeout responses as success",
    "Do not rely on global process state, seeded databases, or external services",
    "Never introduce skip, xfail, or similar tooling to bypass a failing path",
    "Verify observable behavior and return values instead of mock call counts",
    "Assert the exact status code and contractually required payload",
    "Never embed real credentials, bearer tokens, or host-specific secrets",
    "Never hard-code OS-specific paths",
    "Use path.resolve() or path.join() instead of string concatenation",
    "Separation of Concerns: Distinct features with minimal overlap",
    "Modularity: Independent development, testing, deployment",
    "Scalability: Design for horizontal scaling",
    "Maintainability: Simplicity over cleverness"
